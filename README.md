# Karanta OCR
Karanta means "read" in Hausa, a language spoken in Nigeria and other West African countries. This project is a OCR toolkit for processing scanned documents containing content in african languages and extracting the text in them at scale.
This project is a extension of the [OlmoOCR](https://github.com/allenai/olmocr) project with an additional layer containing additional processing to handle multi-article images/documents such as newspaper etc.
